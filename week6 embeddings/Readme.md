	* My Yelp word2vec: https://bl.ocks.org/arnicas/dd2ef348ad8854e40ef2
	* Load job ads data into tensorboard too

## Class activity


Answer some bias questions.

Load some embeddings into tensorboard projector and answer some questions about them.   (Analogy tests on website too.)

* Tool info: https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/embedding
* Public projector using 10K word2vec: http://projector.tensorflow.org/

Do a sprite tsne example.

HW Presentations:

What other "2vec" examples can you find?  What are they encoding? What bias might exist in this data?
