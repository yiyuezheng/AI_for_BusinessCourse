# Week 3: AI Intro.


## In Class

* Quiz review
* Class presentations on ML algs.
* Roc curve code in repo, plus http://gim.unmc.edu/dxtests/roc2.htm.

### Neural Nets:

* Video: Friendly Intro to NeuralNets: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR9h47Jtqyw (skip ahead to 10 minutes in)
* Demo of math inside: https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/2017/02/04/tutorial-3/: Interactive in the middle of the article.
* Demo of weights and simple error: http://www.emergentmind.com/neural-network: Watch as the gray and black update weights as it learns.
* Karpathy's demo of simple models in the browser:
http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/classify2d.html
* https://deeplearnjs.org/#getting-started
* tensorflow demos: http://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.17251&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false : try to solve the spiral (the last example).


## Class activities

* Run logistic regression vs neural net. Results? (Iris example from Safari Online: https://www.safaribooksonline.com/oriole/getting-started-with-deep-learning-using-keras-and-python)


* Logistic regression and other demos: http://joonku.com/project/machine_learning
* Demo classifier(s) and clustering.  https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/

* Carrefour data: what are 5 possible data applications using either neural nets or machine learning.  Give the data type and the machine learning or neural net application that would help you accomplish it. (Feel free to do internet research.)
