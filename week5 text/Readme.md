## Class Activity on RNNs and translation:

Review first:
	* Janelle Shane's results: http://lewisandquark.tumblr.com/, article on Shane's data: http://www.montag.wtf/fun-with-neural-networks/
	* Cyborg writer in browser: https://cyborg.tenso.rs/ and https://cvalenzuela.github.io/Selected_Stories/
	* Using Char-RNN generator Karpathy: Recurrentjs in browser.
	http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/recurrentjs/

* Train char-rnn or word-rnn models and show results.  Use http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/recurrentjs/ and datasets.

* Compare a few sentences in your language in each tool and report which one you think is better.  DeepL translator vs. Google translate: https://www.deepl.com/translator

Submit some good output examples you like from the web page for Char/LSTM-RNN - you can pause it (tell me which dataset you used), and also submit some translation examples. If you can save and upload the json model for me from the webpage that would be great.
