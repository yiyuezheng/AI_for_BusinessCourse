# Final Projects



Using any of the technologies or algorithms we discussed, or any ideas from your Carrefour brainstorming, devise a business plan for a product or feature that uses ML or AI.  It can be for a new company or an existing company.  It can use any type of data.


## Include in your project

* Problem to solve - the business opportunity.
* Other competitors in the space, especially now. These can be examples of other sectors or verticals doing this, as inspiration for your decision-makers.
* Non-data-intensive solutions that exist now. (Is something done by hand, using small data? Is something not automated that could be?)
* Your new data-driven or data-assisted solution: What is your data source?  Do you need training data, and if so, how will you get that?
* How will you ensure data quality? (Garbage in, garbage out...)
* What algorithms will you suggest you use? or models, or approaches?
* How will you handle false positives and false negatives?  (Error in the algorithm output.  Design a plan for dealing with this: reporting it, reviewing it, updating the algorithm if necessary.)
* What is the UX after implementation?  Does it change, or remain the same?  How do you educate users about privacy concerns, decision-making, and opportunities your product offers?  How can you prevent it from being a weapon of math destruction?
* If you fail, how could it "go bad"? What are the impacts of something wrong in your data, your algorithm, your UX, your PR, your business?
* What are some secondary markets/products that this innovation could create?

If you want to focus on an area we didn't discuss directly, like robotic automation or games or music, you can.  But do your research!


Grading criteria:

* 20% solid new business idea and research
* 30% algorithm/data details
* 20% UX / product plan for incorporating it
* 20% Concern for ethics/bias/errors
* 10% Impacts of your idea on your business and growth options

* NOTE: You project must also report who worked on what parts.  I may adjust grading per team member (up or down) based on caliber of the sections if there is a big difference in section quality.
