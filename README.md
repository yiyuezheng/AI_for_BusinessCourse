Readings must be done before class.  Classes will not be lecture, but videos, activities, and demos.  All classes are required.  There is homework due from every class.

There will be presentations by students every week on a specific topic. You will take notes on paper just like I will.  There will be quiz questions about these presentations as well as about the readings.
