# AI For Business Syllabus


This course is an overview of the latest developments in AI and machine learning. It is not a programming course but there will be technical material every week.  You are expected to do your best reading complicated articles about technology and thinking hard about them.  Future managers and product designers of data products need to be as educated as possible about the latest technical research and business opportunities presented.

Readings must be done before class.  Classes will not be lecture, but videos, activities, and demos.  All classes are required.  There is homework due from every class.

There will be presentations by students every week on a specific topic. You will take notes on paper.  There will be quiz questions about these presentations as well as about the readings (I will be taking notes too).
