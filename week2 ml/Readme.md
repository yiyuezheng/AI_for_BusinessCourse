## Class Activities

* Titanic survival activity. Based on article and tree here: https://blog.socialcops.com/engineering/machine-learning-python/.  Notebook is in the class files. (Demo.)

* Also review this in class: Examples of trees: https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880/ch02.html#decision-trees

* Do some image data labeling for classification algorithms using google sheets links and groups.  This is for a research project and for later in the class.
