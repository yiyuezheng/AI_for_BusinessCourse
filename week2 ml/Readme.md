* Quick discussion related to Carrefour data activity:
	* Predicting the death of the Mall, One JC Penney at a Time: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-11/predicting-the-death-of-the-mall-one-j-c-penney-at-a-time?utm_content=graphics&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-graphics

* Class presentations. (Fair game for quiz questions.)
	* Spark vs. Hadoop
	* Firebase vs. BigQuery

* Video, A Friendly Introduction to ML (Luis Serrano): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpGxLWOIZy4
* A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning: http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/ (intro to decision trees)


## Class Activities

* Titanic survival activity. Based on article and tree here: https://blog.socialcops.com/engineering/machine-learning-python/.  Notebook is in the class files. (Demo.)

* Also review this in class: Examples of trees: https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880/ch02.html#decision-trees

* Do some image data labeling for classification algorithms using google sheets links and groups.  This is for a research project and for later in the class.
